# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

> [!hint]
> Sometimes we need to take tests not having enough time to prepare. If we are lucky, the test is online and unsupervised. Then, the only obstacle is time, we have to be fast in finding answers. We prepare these test by carefully arranging our study material and devising the most efficient search strategy. When we see questions, we reach for the answers or for the relevant material and produce the answer. RAG is the equivalent of this strategy for LLMs.

RAG is a sort of **automatic enhancement** of prompts to feed to a Large Language Model (LLM).
