**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a way of enhancing LLMs generation with additional information retrieved from a previously filled database. In simple words, RAG uses a database to retrieve information that is relevant to the *query* and uses such information to construct a more precised and contextualized prompt for the LLM. This page contains useful resources to understand and practice RAG.
