In the <b>Topics</b> section, I gather notes, guides, tutorial, references, and other resources on various topics. Although this page presents topics divided by subject, topics are connected with the idea that it should represent an <i>organic</i> presentation. By design, topics are <b>not</b> linearly ordered (except in this &quot;index&quot; page), but they are linked together based on their content.
