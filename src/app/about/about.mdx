This website gathers material that I wrote and found useful together with ideas, guides, links, and other resources that I use for teaching and studying. 

This is not only a blog, it is also an attempt to group resources that tend to be scattered. For example, it is common to find tutorials and how-tos on some specific technology, often without extensive theoretical and explanatory background. Conversely, theoretical explanations are usually part of *textbooks* and tend to leave hands-on aspects aside. Here, I want to bring the things together, **practice and theory should blend together seamlessly**.

My goal is ambitious and can't be achieved with only a few pages. Despite all, I am determined to pursuit, otherwise, why embarking in yet another blog?

I tried my best to achieve a decent organization, but the broadness covered topics made such task hard. I apologize for that and I will be continuously working to improve the website structure (of course, any suggestion will be welcome).

## About me
Theory and practice are not only the two main character of this site, but they are the two pivots around which my career developed. I'm currently a full time computer science teacher at an Italian technical school. In a previous "life" I have been an academic mostly focused on theoretical aspects of computation, especially in the field of bioinformatics and string algorithm.
