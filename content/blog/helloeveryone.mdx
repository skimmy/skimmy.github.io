Let me introduce myself

> I'm Prof. Schimd computer science and computer engineer teacher, professor, enthusiast, and more...

This blog contains material useful for my classes, but that may be useful to people interested in the topics. Thinking about this double purpose, I structured the content as a more blog rather than as a  hyper-textbook. My hope is that short, practical-oriented articles will be more useful and appealing than long theory-centered chapters.

However, I strongly believe that **practice without theory is like standing on leg, precarious.** Theoretical understanding helps constructing solid competences and durable skills, while keeping your brain active. Hence, blog articles are connected to theoretical (short) pages that focus on the theoretical underpinnings of the discussed subjects. My advice is not to skip this part and try as harder as you can to grasp those concepts.

> [!TIP]
> You can choose to ignore all the theory and read only the practical guides and tutorials, that's absolutely fine to me. However, IMHO you won't get the most out of this blog and you won't be able to fully apply the practical skills into different scenarios.
