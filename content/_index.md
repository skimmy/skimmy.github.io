Welcome to my personal website, here you find posts (mostly) on computer science, machine learning and software development. I'm an enthusiast on programming and software, especially about the algorithmic aspects, but I don't mind get my hands dirty.

**Disclaimer** I use AI and LLMs to improve my content, to brainstorm and search for ideas, and to generate code. I carefully review all AI generated content as I'm fairly skeptical about their capabilities, which are self-evident. In essence, my approach to LLMs is the same for any other tool: use it with a grain a salt.
